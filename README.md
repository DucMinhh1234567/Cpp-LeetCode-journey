# 🚀 My LeetCode Journey

## 🎯 The Beginning
I started my LeetCode journey with a simple goal: to improve my problem-solving skills and master data structures and algorithms. To become a good dev in the future, I chose to implement all solutions in C++ to strengthen my understanding of the language and its features.

## 📈 The Journey
My journey began with easy problems, where I learned fundamental concepts and built confidence. Each problem solved was a step forward in understanding:
- How to approach different types of problems
- When to use specific data structures
- How to optimize solutions for better performance

### 🏆 Small Milestones of Mine
1. **First Binary Search Implementation** (May 23, 2025)
   - Problem: [35. Search Insert Position](Easy/35_Search_Insert_Position.cpp)
   - Learned: How to implement efficient binary search and handle edge cases
   - Achievement: Reduced time complexity from O(n) to O(log n)

2. **First Medium Problem** (May 24, 2024)
   - Problem: [34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array](Medium/34_Find_First_and_Last_Position_of_Element_in_Sorted_Array.cpp)
   - Learned: How to modify binary search for specific requirements
   - Achievement: Successfully implemented a more complex binary search variant

3. **Daily Challenges** (May 24, 2024)
   - Started participating in daily challenges
   - Problem: [2942. Find Words Containing Character](Daily/2942_Find_Words_Containing_Character.cpp)
   - Learned: How to solve problems under time pressure

## 🎯 Current Focus
- Strengthening understanding of binary search and its variations
- Improving string manipulation skills
- Learning to identify patterns in problems
- Building a systematic approach to problem-solving

## 🎯 Future Goals
1. **Short-term Goals**
   - Complete as many Easy problems as possible
   - Master common algorithm patterns
   - Improve solution optimization skills

2. **Medium-term Goals**
   - Tackle more Medium problems
   - Start attempting Hard problems
   - Build a personal problem-solving framework

3. **Long-term Goals**
   - Become proficient in competitive programming
   - Master advanced data structures
   - Help others in their coding journey

## 💻 Why C++?
I chose C++ because:
- It offers fine-grained control over memory and performance
- It's widely used in competitive programming
- It helps understand low-level concepts
- It's valuable for system programming and game development

## 📚 The Learning Process
1. **Understanding the Problem**
   - Read and analyze requirements carefully
   - Identify edge cases
   - Plan the approach

2. **Implementation**
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Use modern C++ features
   - Add detailed comments

3. **Optimization**
   - Analyze time and space complexity
   - Look for better solutions
   - Learn from others' approaches
